# Arrays and Strings

An array, at core, is a block of contiguous memory within a computer. The actual memory addresses in which data will be stored throughout the runtime of a program, are physically next to one another. Strings are merely a special case of array, which are given unique treatment. To make programming faster for the human programmer, most high-level programming languages actually implement a *dynamic array*, also called an *array list*, a class which manages the underlying (static) array out-of-sight and out-of-mind. The python `list` and javascript `array` are examples of this.
